<b> DIARY ENTRY 1  </b> <br>
Okay so um I think I like this girl. She makes me smile SOO much and and wtf I forget everything around her. shes SOOO pretty as well? 
I hope this goes well. <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 2  </b> <br>
OKAY OKAY SO I somehow managed to get her discord I CAN TALK TO HER ONLINE NOW??? Ikr I am so charismatic (please god I really REALLLYYY WANT HER). Also I GOT HER to change her pfp to shrek so like uhhh <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 3 </b> <br>
OKAY so now my mood kinda depends on her texts and whenever I enter the classroom my eyes shift towards her seat. I think I might be going crazy? ALSO SHE TEXTS ME GOODMORNING??? AAAAAAAAAAA I don’t know. But I kinda like it. And also kind hate it. I want to be hers so SO so fucking bad. That would fix everything. <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 4 </b> <br>
Okay yea so I definitely like her. But shes so out of my league? I have absolutely ZERO chance in getting her. so wtf do I do. I want to be hers, but I cant. It SUCKS being ugly. I wish she would think im really hot or something. Well, I guess il just use what I have and do some magic. <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 5  </b><br>
OKAY so shes definitely the one whos doing the magic because im quite literally obsessed. I smile when she smiles? I laugh at her jokes so much? SHE COMPLIMENTED ME?? AND IT MADE ME SMILE EAR TO EAR FOR 5 MINUTES STRAIGHT?? I think I might have a chance. Hopefully I don’t fuck this up. She really means the world to me and I genuinely want to show her all my love and affection. Lord save. OH also I learnt what “its giving” means. HA <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 6 </b> <br>
SHE WISHED ME HAPPY BIRTHDAY??? THAT’S THE BEST PRESENT IVE GOT YET?? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I should ask her out omg. But Drishti keeps saying that she’ll say no so whats the point. BUT ALSO WE KEEP PLAYING GAMES LIKE WHO DO YOU LIKE THIS THAT AND IT SEEMS LIKE SHE MEANS ME?? WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?? I think I might just ask her to get the load off my shoulder.  <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 7 </b> <br>
Okay so that was that. I don’t understand why she hinted liking me if she didn’t wanna get into a relationship. Nihal says it was my self confidence. Yea. I agree. It is pretty fucking bad. But I’ve also heard that girls only use that as an excuse. maybe im too ugly to be loved whsjshjss. 
I really want a second chance. guess ill just hope <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 8 </b> <br>
Yea its awkward to talk to her now. The worst part is I still like her the same if not more. I try convincing myself to not develop feelings again because shell say no anyway but I genuinely love her so so SO much. I do get mad at myself for liking her in the first place, but how could you blame me? Shes literally perfect? I don’t know how ill deal with this. I think I might just try forgetting about her altogether. <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 9 </b> <br>
I know I should’ve asked her out sooner but I just didn’t have the courage to. I want her to be mine or not exist at all, right now its in the middle and its super weird. I just saw her today in a pink traditional outfit and I don’t even know why I blushed. I hate the fact that I like her again and this time I don’t have a way out other than supressing myself. Shes SO beautiful and SO nice and SO perfect. I wish I had her. I wish I was hers. I don’t wanna move on. But I have to. <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 10  </b><br>
OKAY SO UMUM I THINK SHE KINDA LIKES ME AGAIN?? Weve been talking so much she told me my guitar songs are really good (AAAAAAAAAAAA). I feel like im going down the same path again.
I WANT HER I WANT HER I WANT HER AAAAAAA <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 11  </b><br>
We had our field trip today and HOLY shit I couldn’t keep my eyes off her. Even the fucking fried racquets reminded me of her (I need help). Shaurya told me that she was staring at me today? YAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY. I GOT TO TALK to her as well I kept smiling omg. She looked so SO gorgeous. She keeps popping up in my dreams. <br><br>

<b> DIARY ENTRY 12  </b><br>
SHES MINE?!?!?!?!??!?!?! IM HERS!??!?!?!?!?! WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!?!?!
IT all happened so FAST and randomly? I was dared to go tell her a horrible pick up line (I cried) and well haha I thought id just run away after but she goes “YEA SURE”. Hello? That wasn’t in the script. I just keep going because they gave me fucking 3 lines but holy shit I was SO taken aback. My heart was beating so hard it felt like a dream. I came back and she ran away to the bathroom. What the fuck? I asked Kashvi and after persuading her to tell me Kashvi tells me that…. What the fuck. Didn’t she say no before? Didn’t she have to work on herself? That has to be wrong. Maybe shes lying to Kashvi. My heart was fucking RACING. I ask tanay and he says no she doesn’t like me. I said “I KNEW IT" but yea I cant lie it was disappointing. I wanted her to like me back, but I thought that would just never happen. But now it looks like it has? WHAT THE FUCK?? I was so confused. But I decided to shoot my shot because I genuinely wanted her SOOSOSOSO bad. I get her an appy drink from the canteen (very rich yes) and then just jumped directly into it. DO YOU LIKE ME????? She smiles and says what did you say? I knew what I said but her smile literally made me stutter. She looked absolutely ethereal when she smiled. But I tried controlling my words and told it louder. SHE SAID YES?????? MY VISION LITERALLY WENT HAZY? MY HANDS WERE SHAKING. Wait. Wait what the fuck do I do next? I don’t know why I did this but I decided to shake her hands and say “so LIKE im your boyfriend NOW”. Yeaaaaaaaaaaaa haha im very charismatic like that (cough). BUT AAAAAA SHE HELD MY HAND AND SHOOK IT THOUGH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. She also dropped me to my bus? I told her to keep in touch online because I don’t wanna get ghosted. I walk inside the bus with the biggest smile EVER. A billion love songs play in my head. I see my friends and just scream “YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA LETS GOGOGOGOGOOO”. They look at me like im insane but I don’t care. I HAD JUST WON THE LOTTERY? Everyone was confused why she got interested again months later but I couldn’t care less. In my eyes, the only thing I always wanted was finally mine. I WAITED WAYYYYY too long but every SECOND of it was now worth it. I couldn’t stop smiling the entire bus ride. I go home and send her a reel. It was about making it official. AND SHE SENT IT BACK?? YYAYAAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAAAAAAAAAAAAA
IM THE HAPPIEST MAN EVER WITH THE PRETTIEST GIRL EVER YAYYAYYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAY <br><br>
